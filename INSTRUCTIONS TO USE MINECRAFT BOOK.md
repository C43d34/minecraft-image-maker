INSTRUCTIONS TO USE MINECRAFT BOOK IMAGE GENERATOR:



**FIRST,**

 	Make sure you have python installed *(https://www.python.org/downloads/)*

You can check if you have it installed by typing "python" in Command Prompt.



**SECOND,**

 	Create an image. The image you want to convert into Minecraft book image needs to be in the following file types: **.png, .jpg**

(idk what else works)



**Any size and color works!**

I highly recommend the image to be resized down to **72 x 56** and **white/black** only so you would know what it looks like.

The image will be stretched and distrusted a lot being converted from original into ASCII art. Please take note of that!





**THIRD,**

 	Once you have Python and the image ready, open Command Prompt and type "python"

then you can drag "braille\_ascii\_art.py" file into it.

After that, drag the image you want to convert into the command prompt.



Make sure to leave a space between these 3 parts!



When you press enter, it should print a text which you can copy and paste into a Minecraft book.



**Common problems encountered:
Text cannot be pasted into Minecraft book**

That is most likely because your pasted text size is too big.

It will not paste at all if it would go over limit of the Minecraft text.

Also, the script is AI generated that I edited just slightly to make sure it works properly. Please dont blame me if something breaks :(
